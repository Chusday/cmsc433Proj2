			"desc": "This course is designed to introduce students to various technical tools that are currently being used in geography and environmental fields today. GIS, Remote Sensing, GPS and Cartography are discussed in the course. The course covers, among other topics, a basic understanding of how GPS systems function and how they integrate with GIS. The course also provides students a basic understanding of how GPS systems function and how they integrate with GIS. The course also provides students a basic understanding of GIS software and concepts including raster and vector models. Students learn basic map fundamentals such as scale, map interpretation, and projections along with how remote sensing is used in mapping and GIS. The Lab portion of the course provides hands-on examples of different topical areas covered in lecture and how each integrates using real-world examples.",
